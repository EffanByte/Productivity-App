# OMGLEARNING
My 2nd semester project. 
It consists of the following features:
A login system that utilizes a MySQL database to store user data.
A main screen that has multiple models I created in blender and imported to JavaFX using Interactivemesh's .obj importers. 
Most items in the model are clickable and each has a different function.
The white notebook takes me to the todo list where I can input tasks based on difficulty and earn XP by finishing them.
The plant logs me out.
The bookcase shows me my stats.
The Alarm clock takes me to a pomodoro timer, where I can start a timer and earn XP based on my study time.
I added switches and a lamp to make JavaFX's lighting system interact with the models to make it more life-like.

I used absolute addresses for all the images/textures I added so I might have to redo that part so that the program is easier to run.
